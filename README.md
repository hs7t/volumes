# Volumes

Volumes is a daily word game inspired by the "examples" sections of dictionaries. This repository
holds the front-end code for it. You can play Volumes at [my website](https://volumes.hvii.cc/),
or check out the source here! (It's really bad. I'm sorry).

## Running Volumes yourself

Volumes comes in two independent parts: the Volumes website (this repo) and the Volume Network 
([volnet](https://github.com/hs7t/volnet/)). Volumes (the website) interfaces with volnet through 
calls to its public API!
